How to play an internet game:

1. Make sure you're on the same LAN
2. Have one person launch the game and go to Multiplayer>Internet Game. YOU ARE PLAYER 1.
3. Record the IP it gives you, but keep the game running.
4. Have the other person launch and to go Multiplayer, type in the ip where it says "localhost", then click "Connect" YOU ARE PLAYER 2.
5. ????
6. Profit


How Players Work:

If you are on the left side of the screen, you are Player 1, and use W and S to move.
If you are on the right side of the screen, you are Player 2, and use UP and DOWN to move.
If you are the host of an internet game, you are Player 1 automatically.
If you are the client, you are Player 2 automatically.
